# PMPP-Solutions
This repository contains my personal solutions to exercises from the book 
"Programming Massively Parallel Processors" 4-th edition. 
As a beginner, I aim to explore and learn parallel programming concepts. 

Please note that these solutions are **not** guaranteed to be correct. 
If you find any mistakes, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
